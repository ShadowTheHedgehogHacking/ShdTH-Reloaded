$=== Preference Codes ===
00000000 00000000
*DON'T TURN THIS CODE ON.
*Below are some codes that are more preference-driven.
*You may adjust them as you desire, but it's recommended to keep them as-is otherwise.
*
$Simple Widescreen [CosmoCortney, TeconMoon, LimblessVector]
0458412c 3f9f7cee
*Requires Dolphin to be forced 16:9.
*Movies, HUD, and menus are stretched to cover the screen.
*Some small things to fix involve skewing drawn elements too far and Chaos Control squishing the FOV too much.
*
*
$Disable Bloom [gamemasterplc]
044978f0 60000000
*Completely removes the bloom effect.
*Some areas become much darker with the effect off.
*Recommended OFF, unless the bloom effect really bothers you.
*
*
$Disable Partner Intro [LimblessVector]
0857d77B 00000001
000B0004 00000000
*Disables the special zoom-in camera that typically plays the first time you meet a partner in a stage or story.
*
$=== Cheats ===
00000000 00000000
*DON'T TURN THIS CODE ON.
*Below are some cheat codes.
*Use your own judgement if you want to use them.
*
$Infinite Lives [Link Master]

*
$Game Speed Multiplier [Link Master, LimblessVector]
0457d6bc 3f666666
*Slows or raises the speed of the game while in a stage. Menus, framerate, and audio is unaffected.
*If you'd like a custom speed, then replace the second half of this code with a floating point number, in hexadecimal.
*0.5 : 3f000000

*
$=== Major Physics ===
00000000 00000000
*DON'T TURN THIS ON
*Below are core changes to how physics affect gameplay. Enabling these will probably break stage object interaction, even though some object IC's have been adjusted to compensate. You may be flung into pits or get caught in input-disabling trigger areas.
*
$Air Friction
045e4580 40100000
*3->2.2
*Lowered. Player will keep more air momentum longer.
*
$Character Gravity
045f2bd8 c3a28000
*-320->-325
*Strengthened. Player will fall faster and gain less height from upwards velocity.
*Affects both player and partner characters.
*
$Gravity/Jump Modifier
045e4584 3f666666
*1->0.9
*Lowered. Allows player to jump higher, but fall faster.
*
$Dash Ramp Force
045f3af4 bf59999a
*-1->-0.85
*Weakened to compensate for less air friction.
*
$Spring Strength
045f3ee4 3f600000
*1->0.875
*Weakened to compensate for less air friction.
*
$=== Minor Physics ===
00000000 00000000
*DON'T TURN THIS ON
*Below are less extensive physics and other moveset edits. These can probably be used with or without the major physics changes with no game-breaking implications.
*
$Jump Ball Turn Speed
045F2788 41c80000
*6.5->25
*Increased. Player turns faster while in jump ball.
*
$Jump Ball Duration
045F2794 3f700000
*0.75->0.9375
*Increased. Player can hold the jump button to stay in jump ball form slightly longer, allowing for more time floating at the apex.
*
$Jump Dash Duration
045F27A0 3f400000
*0.4->0.75
*Increased. Shadow will stay in the jump dash state slightly longer.
*
$Jump Dash Initial Velocity
045F27A8 432f0000
*180->175
*Lowered.
*
$Jump Dash Gradual Velocity
045F27B0 43898000
*430->275
*Lowered. Less of the forward momentum from a jump dash is forced.
*
$Jump Dash Steer
045F27B4 43960000
*220->300
*Increased. The player has more influence over how Shadow drifts during jump dash.
*
$Jump Dash Turn Speed
045F27B8 41c80000
*6.5->25
*Increased. The player can turn faster in jump dash.
*
$Jump Dash Momentum Thingy
045f27a4 7f800000
*It does SOMETHING.
*
$Chaos Blast Range
045ee390 43d48000
*200->425
*Increased. Chaos Blast now covers over twice as much area.
*
$Jump Attack Friction
045e4588 40800000
*10->4
*Lowered. Shadow carries a little more momentum before coming to a stop when he attacks in midair (with a weapon or with a melee kick).
*
$Light Dash ValidRing Distance
045ee460 42c80000
*80->100
*Increased. While already Light Dashing, Shadow checks further ahead for the next ring to dash to.
*
$Light Dash ValidRing Angle
045f280c 42700000
*45->60
*Increased. While already Light Dashing, Shadow checks in a wider angle for the next ring to dash to.
*
$Lock-on Gun Shot Interval
045e3d18 3e000000
*0.25->0.125
*Lowered. Lock-on type weapons have less delay between shots when multiple targets are selected.
*
$Slide Steer
045F28A0 40800000
045EE4A0 40000000
*2->4
*Increased. Shadow has more turn control while sliding.
*Also has bugfix to Slide Scale, since it seems to copy off Steer at init, for some reason.
*
$Slide Run Threshhold
045ee414 42960000
*200->75
*Lowered. Shadow can slide instead of spindash at a lower run speed.
*
$Spindash Startup Delay
045ee4b4 3f800000
*0.25->1
*Increased, but spindash should be releasable sooner.
*
$Strafe Walk Speed
045ee418 425c0000
*30->55
*Increased. Shadow's strafe walk speed is higher.
*
$Homing Attack Speed
045F2720 453b8000
*1000->3000
*Increased. Shadow will home in on targets faster.
*
$Homing Attack Turn Strength
045F2724 42c80000
*8->100
*Increased. Shadow won't do wide arcs when doing a Homing Attack, and will instead go straight towards his target.
*
$Triangle Jump Recover Time
045f295c 358637bd
*0.125->0.000001
*Lowered. Shadow can do another triangle jump immediately upon landing.
*
$Triangle Jump Speed
045f2978 44960000
*450->1200
*Increased. Triangle Jumps travel faster.
*
$WallRun Speed
045f2958 44098000
*500->550
*Increased. Shadow wall runs faster.
*
$Walk Turn Speed
045f268c 41a00000
*15->20
*Increased. Shadow turns faster when walking and standing.
*
$Heal Unit Explosion Hitbox Size
045f39d8 42340000
*20->45
*Increased. The explosion from a heal unit or heal gun now has a larger effect radius.
*
$Pulley Speed
045f409c 3e666666
*0.18->0.225
*Increased. Pulleys raise and lower faster.
*
$Red Slime Speed
045ee3c0 43d48000
*340->425
*Increased. Shadow travels faster through red slime.
*
$=== WIP Codes ===

*Below is my WIP stuff.
*
$Disable Enemy Passive Hitbox [LimblessVector]
041a8494 4e800020
*This makes touching normal grounded and airborne enemies harmless. The one exception seems to be the Larvae.

0400ab94 60000000
0400ab98 60000000
0400ab9c 60000000
*Makes touching an enemy that is piloting a vehicle harmless. Tested with Saucer.
*HAS A GAME-BREAKING VISUAL GLITCH.  Camera horribly distorts when manually controlled or when in certain stages.
*
$Timer and Scores persist on respawn [LimblessVector]

0416f650 60000000
0416f654 60000000
04178bc4 60000000
*Instead of scores resetting and the timer reverting on respawn, they instead all persist.
*
*Will probably make the scores instead revert to previous checkpoint's scores if possible. Otherwise may be exploitable by purposely dying after gaining a large score bump and repeating. Or have a percentage score penalty.
