*
$Bloom Reduction [TheHatedGravity]
0456ac30 3ec00000
*Bloom intensity multiplier. Lessens the bloom effect to a more reasonable level.
*If you'd like a custom amount, then replace the second half of this code with a floating point number, in hexadecimal.
*Examples:
*0.25 : 3e800000
*0.375: 3ec00000
*0.5  : 3f000000
*0.95 : (default)
*
$Bloom Disable [unknown, dreamsyntax]
0442fb10 60000000
