Take one of the honban_EN files depending on your preference: 4:3 or 16:9. Rename to honban_EN.txd and place within your iso's csdFiles folder.

For the dolphin textures, add the textures in GUPE8P to Documents/Dolphin Emulator/Load/Textures/GUPE8P
... or wherever your installation keeps its cross-version files. Both widescreen and standard layout replacements are in there. Enable them under Dolphin's Graphics/Advanced/Load Custom Textures.

You might have to raise the internal resolution to notice a difference though.
