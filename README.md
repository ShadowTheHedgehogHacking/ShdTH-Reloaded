Shadow the Hedgehog: Reloaded is a quality of life and enhancement mod for the original Shadow the Hedgehog.

Reloaded is for the NTSC GameCube version, playable via Dolphin emulator and Nintendont for Wii / Wii U.

Reloaded is still in-progress. The project goals are listed below, and are at varying levels of completeness. A more verbose and detailed changelist can be found on the Changelist page once the first release is finalized.

## Less Tedious Gameplay
The primary goal is to make the game less tedious and annoying, both on a short and long term scale. This is mainly accomplished by; 
- Lowering mission objective numbers.
- Increasing the available objects for missions.
- Lowering the number of endings needed to unlock Last Story.
- Changing the Expert Mode unlock requirement to unlock after beating Last Story.
- Making slow elevators and such move much faster.
- Cutscenes are always skippable.
- And countless adjustments to stage object layouts, for less haphazard placement.

## More Genuine Challenge
The secondary goal is to make the game more fun by increasing its challenge and replayability, where appropriate. While the game's artificial difficulty (padded story requirements and inflated mission objectives) is minimized, authentic difficulty is enchanced.
- All stage rankings are much harder.
- Expert mode is much harder and more unique.
- The Secret Door system was reworked into simply being additional pathways instead of one-time useless bonuses.
- Secret Keys were changed to Red Rings and have been shuffled around here and there.
- And many changes to stage object layouts, for more challenge in some areas.

## Misc. Quality of Life Changes
Many other miscellaneous annoyances are also addressed.
- Checkpoint collision no longer slows down Shadow.
- Shadow’s Homing Attack homes in much faster and has perfect tracking; no more orbiting around your target.
- Shadow can now use the Slide move for as long as the melee (B) button is held down.
- The jumping GUN mech has an improved hover ability.
- And many more small changes.

## Refreshed Art
And finally, some artistic changes were made to improve the game’s art style and presentation.
- The menus were updated in a new style.
- The palette of some stages were redone so they would be more vibrant and less dull.
- An optional texture pack of enhanced (not upscaled!) textures was compiled for Dolphin. This pack uses; 
  - Uncompressed textures from the Xbox version,
  - The highest resolution available for each texture (some stages used low res versions of many textures),
  - Some imported textures from Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, and Sonic Heroes,
  - And a few custom textures for the remaining edge cases.
- An additional optional texture pack of upscaled textures was made using the above as the basis.
- Some music tracks that went unused in-game are added.
  - “E.G.G.M.A.N. (Doc Robeatnix Mix)” was added to the Lava Shelter version of the Egg Dealer boss. The Egg Dealer theme still plays in the other Egg Dealer fights.
  - “What I Am” by Magna-Fi replaces “Almost Dead” by Powerman 5000 for the GUN Fortress endings.
  - “Broken” by Sins of a Divine Mother is added as a unique ending theme to the Black Comet endings, instead of reusing the GUN Fortress ending theme.
  - Expert Mode’s ending has a unique theme and credits animation. ;)
