## About
This project aims to modify the core physics to retain momentum similar to Sonic Adventure 2 and alter layout design to reduce 'stop and go' gameplay.


## Goals (Incomplete)
- More gradual momentum loss when you let go of the stick while running. No more "let go of stick and come to a dead stop"
- Faster run turning, so less "swingy" turning at top speed
- Possibly lower top run speed to compensate for more sensitive turning (hopefully while not lowering run speed cap?)
- Keeping horizontal air momentum when landing
- Less air friction so you don't slow down as fast (already possible)
- Slightly higher gravity for a bit more challenge and speed (already possible)
- More air "control" for better maneuverability
